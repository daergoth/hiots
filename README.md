### Project status
It looks complete! And the emphasis is on the 'looks', yet.  
However I feel 90% sure, that changes won't be needed on the future.
I highly recommend to try it out, mess around with it. If you find some flaws or bugs, please contact me with it.   
Feedback is always really appreciated! :)

### Summary
HIoTS is my try to simulate a home with smart devices everywhere.  
All the sensors around the house collect incredible amount of data and actors (devices with functional purpose) will work with that data. On the web interface, users can control how the system works, set up dashboards for monitors (display devices with only system monitoring functions) or set up sensors/actors.

### Tasklist
- [x] Working sensors with fake data
- [x] Working actors
- [x] Working monitors
- [x] Rule system - creating rules with IF/THEN format

### Future goals
- Statistics with recorded sensor readings
- Make more types of sensors and actors
- Compatibility with real life devices
- and more...
