# HIoTS - Home IoT System
## Project for ProgTech and ProgEnv courses

### Summary
HIoTS is my try to simulate a home with smart devices everywhere.
All the sensors around the house collect incredible amount of data and actors (devices with functional purpose) will work with that data. On the web interface, users can control how the system works, set up dashboards for monitors (display devices with only system monitoring functions) or set up sensors/actors.

### Tasklist
- [x] Working sensors with fake data
- [ ] Working actors
- [ ] Working monitors
- [ ] Rule system - creating rules with IF/THEN format
